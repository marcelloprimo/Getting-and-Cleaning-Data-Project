# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. In order to do so I was requested to submit the following: 1) a tidy data set 2) a link to a Github repository with my script for performing the analysis 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. 4) a README.md (THIS TEXT) in the repo that explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

# The original data sets
The original data sets are obtained from the following link "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.netgetdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip" created as described in  "http://archive.ics.uci.edumldatasetsHuman+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones"

# The files contained in this repo
The tidy data set is obtained by running the run_analysis.R program, that is contained in this repo. The script "run_analysis.R" is self-explaining, in that it strictly follows the assignments and contains several comments that should clarify the meaning of each line of code. Maybe the code is not the best possible one, i.e. the most elegant, effective and efficient, but works well and produces a tidy data set.

The repo also contains this README.md file as described above, and the CodeBook.md describing the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.
